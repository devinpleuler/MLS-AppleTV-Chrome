This is a Chrome Extension to improve the analysis experience while watching a MLS game on Apple TV. It removes the gradient overlay that appears when playback is paused, and removes the controls that pop-up in the middle of the screen (use your keyboard instead).


- Download extension from [here](https://github.com/devinpleuler/MLS-AppleTV-Chrome/raw/main/mls_apple_tv.zip) and unzip it.
- View your [Extensions](chrome://extensions) in Google Chrome.
- Enable `Developer Mode` in the top-right corner
- Click `Load Unpacked` and select the folder you unzipped.
- Visit Apple TV on Chrome to test
